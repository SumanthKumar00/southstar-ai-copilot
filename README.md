🤖 Southstar Tech AI Copilot – Enterprise RAG Assistant

    This project delivers an AI-powered internal copilot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It enables users to ask natural language questions and receive grounded answers from company documents, along with source citations and feedback tracking.
    The system simulates an enterprise knowledge assistant used for policy lookup, compliance questions, and operational support.

    You can ask questions like:
    A)Who is responsible for reviewing the access control policy?
    B)How often should access permissions be reviewed?
    C)How often should access permissions be reviewed?
    D)What is the company’s vacation policy?

Workflow Summary

1.Document Source

    Internal PDFs and files (policies, onboarding docs, checklists)

2.Vectorization Layer

    a)Documents are chunked
    b)Text embeddings generated using HuggingFace models
    c)Stored in a Chroma vector database

3.Retrieval Layer (RAG)
    
    a)User question converted to embedding
    b)Top relevant document chunks retrieved
    c)Context sent to LLM for grounded answer

4.LLM Response Generation

    a)LLM answers only using retrieved context 
    b)Returns answer + source citations

5.UI Layer
    
    a)Built with Streamlit chat interface
    b)Real-time Q&A experience
    c)Feedback & Analytics Layer

6.User ratings stored

    a)Helpful / Not helpful tracking
    b)Feedback saved to feedback.csv for analysis

📊 Capabilities
    
📄 Enterprise Knowledge Search

    a)Ask questions about policies and procedures
    b)Find specific rules or compliance info
    c)Get answers grounded in documents

🔎 Source Transparency

    a)Every answer shows document name and page number
    b)Prevents hallucinations
    c)Builds trust in AI outputs

⭐ Feedback System

    a)Users rate answer
    b)Suggest improvements
